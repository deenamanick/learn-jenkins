### **Scenario Introduction: Handling Success & Failure in Jenkins Pipeline**  

In a **Jenkins Pipeline**, different execution scenarios can occur, and we need to handle them properly. The three most common scenarios are **success**, **failure**, and **aborted**. Jenkins provides a **post** section to define actions based on these outcomes.

---

### **Scenario 1: Successful Execution (`success`)**  
‚úÖ **What Happens?**  
- All pipeline stages execute successfully without errors.  
- The pipeline reaches the final stage and completes.  
- Logs will indicate the pipeline finished successfully.  

‚úÖ **How to Handle?**  
- Notify users about successful deployment.  
- Send an email or Slack notification.  
- Log the success message.  

‚úÖ **Example Code:**  
```groovy
post {
    success {
        echo 'Pipeline executed successfully!'
    }
}
```

---

### **Scenario 2: Failure (`failure`)**  
‚ùå **What Happens?**  
- A stage fails due to an error in the script, such as a Docker build failure or a missing dependency.  
- The pipeline stops at the failed stage.  
- Jenkins logs the failure and marks the build as **failed**.  

‚ùå **How to Handle?**  
- Notify users about the failure.  
- Capture logs for debugging.  
- Trigger a rollback or cleanup process.  

‚ùå **Example Code:**  
```groovy
post {
    failure {
        echo 'Pipeline failed! Investigate the issue.'
        sh 'sudo docker ps'  // Check running containers in case of a failure
    }
}
```

---

### **Scenario 3: Aborted Execution (`aborted`)**  
üõë **What Happens?**  
- The pipeline is **manually stopped** by the user or by Jenkins due to external factors.  
- It may happen due to **manual intervention** or a **timeout setting**.  
- Jenkins logs indicate the build was aborted.  

üõë **How to Handle?**  
- Log an appropriate message.  
- Notify stakeholders.  
- Perform cleanup actions if needed.  

üõë **Example Code:**  
```groovy
post {
    aborted {
        echo 'Pipeline was aborted!'
        sh 'sudo docker ps'  // Check if any containers are still running
    }
}
```

---

### **Final Enhanced `post` Section**
Here‚Äôs how we integrate all three scenarios into our Jenkinsfile:
```groovy
post {
    always {
        sh 'sudo docker images'
    }
    success {
        echo 'Pipeline executed successfully! Deployment was completed.'
    }
    failure {
        echo 'Pipeline failed! Investigate the issue.'
        sh 'sudo docker ps'
    }
    aborted {
        echo 'Pipeline was aborted by the user!'
        sh 'sudo docker ps'
    }
}
```

---

### **Example Execution Scenarios**
| Scenario  | Example Cause | Jenkins Outcome | Post-Action |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|-------------|
| ‚úÖ **Success** | Docker image builds and deploys correctly | Marked as `SUCCESS` | Logs success message |
| ‚ùå **Failure** | Docker build fails due to missing dependencies | Marked as `FAILURE` | Logs error, checks running containers |
| üõë **Aborted** | User manually stops the pipeline | Marked as `ABORTED` | Logs the action, checks running containers |

---

### **Conclusion**
By handling success, failure, and aborted scenarios properly, we ensure:
‚úÖ Clear logs for debugging  
‚úÖ Automated notifications for stakeholders  
‚úÖ System cleanup to avoid resource wastage  

Would you like to integrate **email notifications** for failures? üöÄ

Execution Flow
1Ô∏è‚É£ Verifies Docker and Git installation.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Builds Docker Image only if on the main branch.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Shows available Docker images.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Asks for manual approval before deploying the container.
5Ô∏è‚É£ Cleans up unused images after deployment.
6Ô∏è‚É£ Handles all post scenarios (success, failure, and abort).
