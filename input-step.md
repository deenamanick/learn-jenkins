### Explanation of `input` Step in Jenkinsfile  

The **`input` step** in Jenkins declarative pipelines is used to **pause the pipeline execution** and ask for **manual approval** before proceeding to the next steps.

#### **Syntax in the 'Docker-Deploy' Stage**  
```groovy
input {
    message "Do you want to proceed for deployment ?"
}
```

#### **How It Works**  
1. **Pipeline Execution Stops:** When the pipeline reaches the **Docker-Deploy** stage, it **pauses execution**.  
2. **User Approval Required:** Jenkins displays a prompt with the message:  
   - **"Do you want to proceed for deployment?"**  
   - The user must **manually approve** the step in the Jenkins UI.  
3. **Pipeline Resumes or Aborts:**  
   - If the user **approves**, the pipeline proceeds with deployment.  
   - If the user **rejects or ignores** it, the pipeline will stay paused until action is taken or it times out.

#### **Use Cases**  
- Ensures that deployment happens only after **human verification**.  
- Useful for **production deployments** where manual intervention is necessary.  
- Prevents accidental deployments due to automated triggers.

Would you like to customize this further (e.g., add a timeout or specific user roles for approval)? ðŸ˜Š
