ðŸŽ¯ What is the Use of Parallel Stages?


Parallel execution helps speed up the pipeline by running independent tasks at the same time.

âœ… Benefits:

Faster execution: Instead of running Docker-Verify and Git-Verify one after the other, they now run simultaneously.
Efficient resource usage: Utilizes Jenkins agents better.
Reduces pipeline runtime, especially useful for large builds.
In your case:

Docker-Verify and Git-Verify donâ€™t depend on each other.
Running them in parallel inside Pre-Checks makes the pipeline faster.
